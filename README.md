# German Dictionary #

This application lets users create their own custom dictionaries. German words and their translations are inserted into the dictionary and are sorted alphabetically. The dictionary can be filtered by nouns, verbs or other words and searched by either word or translation. A Word document can be created at any time if the user wants to print the existing dictionary. There is also an option of choosing two languages, English (default) and Serbian.

This app was initially requested by a person with very limited knowledge of English, hence the need for an additional language. But it can be used by anyone learning German, who prefers typing, rather than writing, or just needs a faster way to find a word in his/her own dictionary; and there's the option of automatically making a formatted word document, ready for printing.
  
  
Enclosed is a sample dictionary with a few dozen words.
